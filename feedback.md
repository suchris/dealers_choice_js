Great job, Christine! 5 outta 5 ðŸ¤©! I love the detail you put into your readme! Your models are very nicely set up and your SQL queries are very solid! Your code is simple and easy to read. Your getDataFromCMC file is the most sophisticated code I've seen while grading so far. I love the utils file and helper function. You've truly done a phenomenal job with this!
